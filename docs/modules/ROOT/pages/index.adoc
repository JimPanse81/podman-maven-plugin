The `podman-maven-plugin` is a maven plugin that allows you to build, tag and push OCI compliant containe images that are configured using a `Dockerfile` or a `Containerfile` using Podman.

== About
:navtitle: About

This plugin was created based on the need to build container images with Podman, whilst not having an appropriate plugin to do so. Initially using the docker-maven-plugin from fabric8io it quickly became clear that simply swapping Docker for Podman (alias docker=podman) did not work as the plugin requires a Docker outlet to communicate with. With other plugins currently not yet available, the idea was born.

This plugin uses a ProcessExecutor from ZeroTurnaround to do its magic under water. Although this plugins' structure is similar to that from the docker-maven-plugin, its implementation is not. In an effort to keep things simple, I have chosen to use a ProcessExecutor to run podman rather than implementing the logic myself.

Also, only a subset of the podmans capabilities have been implemented (build, push and save).

This plugin is mainly inspired by the docker-maven-plugin and shows some similarities in configuration.

== Goals Overview
[#goals]
:navtitle: Goals

This plugin has three goals:

xref:goals/build.adoc[podman:build]::
Builds _and_ tags a configured container image. This goal is bound to the `install` phase.

xref:goals/push.adoc[podman:push]::
Pushes a container image to the registry. This goal is bound to the `deploy` phase

xref:goals/copy.adoc[podman:copy]::
Copies images listed on the `container-catalog.txt` from the listed registry to a specified registry. This goal is bound to the `deploy` phase

xref:goals/clean.adoc[podman:clean]::
Cleans up the local Podman root storage. This goal is bound to the `pre-clean` phase.

xref:goals/save.adoc[podman:save]::
Saves an image as a `tar.gz` file to the local disk. This goal is not bound to any phase.

== Requirements
[#requirements]
:navtitle: Requirements

- Maven 3.6.2 or later
- Java 8 or later
- Podman to be installed on the OS where this plugin will run
- Registry configuration to be present in Maven settings.
- Dockerfile or Containerfile to be present in the module

NOTE: This Plugin only works when a Containerfile is in your module's folder. You cannot create a complete Containerfile via configuration in the `pom.xml`.

NOTE: To stay in line with terminology used by Podman, we'll be using the term Containerfile instead of Dockerfile.

== Command line
[#commandline]
:navtitle: Command line
You can also call this plugin from the command line by invoking either of its Mojo's directly, i.e. via `mvn podman:build` or `mvn podman:push` after running a `mvn install`.

== Using parameters in your Containerfile
[#usingparams]
:navtitle: Parameters

It is possible to specify properties in your pom file and use those properties in the Containerfile, just like you would in a pom file:

.Example Containerfile
[source,Dockerfile]
----
FROM ${container.base.image}

WORKDIR /application
COPY ${project.artifactId}.jar ./
----
